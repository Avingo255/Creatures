# Creatures

Creatures is a small evolution simulator. It's about creatures trying to survive and procreate.
Each new creature inherits the properties of its parents, combined with mutations. This leads to gradual changes in the
distribution of certain attributes. These changes can be graphically seen in a statistics module.

### Build

This project uses [Gradle](https://gradle.org/). The gradle wrapper is also included, so gradle doesn't need to be
